# groupproject1
DBC Group Project 1
* This will probably be the best group project ever


# Presentation Requirements

The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows.

Your presentation must:

* [ ] Be at least 8-10 min. long

* [ ] Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.

* [ ] Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them

* [ ] Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions

* [ ] Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

* [ ] Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

* [ ] Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)

* [ ] Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".

* [ ] Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.

# Presentation Guidelines

You are free to structure your presentations to your liking, but students tend to have success with the following format.

* Title Slide

  * Include the name of the Project and Group Members

* Motivation & Summary Slide

  * Define the core message or hypothesis of your project.
  * Describe the questions you asked, and _why_ you asked them
  * Describe whether you were able to answer these questions to your satisfaction, and briefly summarize your findings

* Questions & Data

  * Elaborate on the questions you asked, describing what kinds of data you needed to answer them, and where you found it

* Data Cleanup & Exploration

  * Describe the exploration and cleanup process
  * Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
  * Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Data Analysis

  * Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Discussion

  * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

* Post Mortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?

* Questions
  * Open-floor Q&A with the audience

*Project Proposal:*

Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

* The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)

* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data

* Possible source for such data

In other words, write down what kind of data you plan to work with, and what kinds of questions you'd like to ask of it. This constitutes your Project Proposal/Outline, and should look something like this:

> Our project is to uncover patterns in criminal activity around Los Angeles. We'll examine relationships between types of crime and location; crime rates and times of day; trends in crime rates over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.


## Development Requirements
* Use Pandas to clean and format your data sets
* Create Jupyter Notebook describing **data exploration and cleanup**
* create a Jupyter Notebook illustraing the **final data analysis**
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instrucitonal team and for inclusion in your presenatation
* Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings

## Suggested Data Sources
Stick to data sources that
* Are sufficiently large
* Have consistent data
* Ideally contain more data than needed
* Are well-documented (World Bank is not Good)
